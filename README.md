### Wireframes
- The very first wireframe i created of my project was by pen and paper, which i have included below. 
![Oisin Rings Pen&Paper1](assets/images/Wireframe-com.jpg)
![Oisin Rings Pen&Paper2](assets/images/wireframe-tab.jpg)
![Oisin Rings Pen&Paper3](assets/images/wireframe-phone.jpg)
- As you can see its a very rough outline of the finished product but together with the Story board i created in the projects section of my repository i was able to make sense of it rather quickly.

## Design

With the overall design i tried to stay as minimalistic as possible with a single page application structure. The responsive layout guarantees a consistent and beautiful presentation across all devices, relating to the brand's commitment to quality from every perspective.


### Font and Colour choices

**Fonts:** The typography of Oising Rings combines classic elegance with a distinct artisan feel, using fonts imported from Google Fonts.
'Georgia', serif: This traditional serif font is used for the body text and card-title, providing top readability for paragraphs and a timeless feel that aligns with the handcrafted nature of the jewellery. It's a highly accessible font with good legibility.

**Colours:** This site is designed with a sophisticated color palette, comprising soft beiges and subtle dark earthy tones, forms the foundational backdrop, allowing the intricate details of the jewelry to be highlighted. This is contrasted by a vibrant crimson red for key heading.

 **Primary Background (`#f3efe7`)** 
 - A soft, light beige providing a warm and inviting base, reminiscent of natural stone or parchment.
 
 **Secondary Background (`#e2dcd0`)**
 - A slightly darker, muted beige used for elements like the navbar, adding subtle depth.
 
 **Body Text (`#2d2b27`)**

 **Hero Heading Accent (`#DC143C` - Crimson Red)**
 - A vibrant, bold red specifically chosen for the main hero heading to create a strong visual impact and draw immediate attention.
 
 **Button Primary (`#6b4c2b`)**
 - A robust, medium-dark brown for primary call-to-action buttons, suggesting durability and natural materials.
 
 **Button Secondary (`#a0855b`)**

### Future Implementations

**Blog/News Section**: Add a blog to share insights into the crafting process, new collections, or behind-the-scenes content.
 
**User Accounts**: Allow users to create accounts to save preferences, track orders, and manage custom design inquiries.
 
**Image Gallery for Custom Designs**: Showcase a portfolio of past custom ring projects to inspire potential clients.
 
**Interactive Design Tool**: Potentially implement a simple tool for users to visualize basic custom ring elements.

### Accessibility
Accessibility has been considered throughout the development process to ensure my project is usable by as many people as possible.

**Semantic HTML**: Used appropriate HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`) to provide a clear structure for assistive technologies.

**Clear Contrast**: The color scheme has been chosen to provide good contrast between text and background, particularly for the main body text (`#2d2b27` on `#f3efe7`).

**Accessible Fonts**: 'Georgia' is a highly readable and generally accessible serif font. While 'Cinzel Decorative' is more ornate for the hero `h1`, it's used sparingly and for prominent, short text.

**`alt` attributes**: All `<img>` tags include descriptive `alt` attributes to provide context for screen readers.

**Form Labels**: All form inputs are associated with `<label>` tags for improved usability and accessibility.

**Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, ensuring content is accessible and usable on various screen sizes and devices.
