## Design

<!-- Add a section about the DESIGN later --> 

### Wireframes
- The first wireframe in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wT3sdUsGl5XI6l3T6eq9bs/CI-Project-1?node-id=35%3A111) is a very simple design. It also shows an alternative option for the homepage layout which could be implemented in the future.

### Font and Colour choices

**Fonts:** The typography of Oising Rings combines classic elegance with a distinct artisan feel, using fonts imported from Google Fonts.
'Georgia', serif: This traditional serif font is used for the body text and card-title, providing top readability for paragraphs and a timeless feel that aligns with the handcrafted nature of the jewellery. It's a highly accessible font with good legibility.

**Colours:** This site is designed with a sophisticated color palette, comprising soft beiges and subtle dark earthy tones, forms the foundational backdrop, allowing the intricate details of the jewelry to be highlighted. This is contrasted by a vibrant crimson red for key heading.
